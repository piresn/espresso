# To do:

- add filters per project

- write help page

- there are currently 3 separate calls to getBM. Try to simplify. Or just create table with all gene names.

- add more data

- save counts as binary instead of csv
  - or at least specify (UTF-8?) encodings


# Bugs

- plot not distinguishing groups - maybe because offline?
- gene abo on mouse gives error
- also - in human there are two ensembl annotation for abo
