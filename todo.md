# To do:

- add filters per project - trying to create input$experiments filter (see test.R, but not working - crashes when run app)

- write help page

- there are currently 3 separate calls to getBM. Try to simplify. Or just create table with all gene names.

- add more data

- save counts as binary instead of csv
  - or at least specify (UTF-8?) encodings


# Bugs

- gene abo on mouse gives error
- also - in human there are two ensembl annotation for abo
